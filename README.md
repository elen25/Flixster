# Flixster
Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

## Flix Part 1
- [X] User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.
- [X] Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [X] In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [X] In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [ ] Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.
